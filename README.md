# Altimeter for Antigravity

**Altimeter** is an extension for monitoring used/spent tokens in Antigravity IDE, providing simple yet powerful token usage stats. It brings deep observability to the Antigravity Language Server, offering a visual dashboard for monitoring session performance and model-specific usage metrics directly in the IDE.

## Features

- **Automatic Service Discovery**: Should support separate processes on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Token Statistics**: Clear breakdown of **Input**, **Cache**, and **Output** tokens.
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Visual horizontal stacked bar charts and daily breakdown tables for long-term usage trends.
- **Sidebar**: View current session information and usage stats directly in the sidebar.

## Inspiration & References

This project stands on the shoulders of giants and adjacent explorations:

- **Tokscale**: Inspired by discussions and concepts around token scaling. See [Issue #40](https://github.com/junhoyeo/tokscale/issues/40) for related context.
- **Antigravity Cockpit**: We examined [vscode-antigravity-cockpit](https://github.com/jlcodes99/vscode-antigravity-cockpit) to understand an interaction with the Antigravity Language Server.
- **Google APIs**: Heavily utilized [googleapis](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis.git) for robust protocol buffer integration and data structure alignment.
- **Gemini CLI & Similar Tools**: Inspired by tools like the Gemini CLI which provide token usage transparency, empowering developers to improve their work effectiveness by understanding the cost and weight of their interactions.
